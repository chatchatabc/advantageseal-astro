1. Rotary ring
   It rotates together with the pump shaft, and is closely fitted with the static ring to form a sealing surface to prevent medium leakage.It sliding with the static ring, when the sealing surface wear, moving ring can be axial movement for automatic compensation, keep the sealing surface good fit.
   <br />
2. Stationary ring
   It is fixed on the pump housing, which is paired with the moving ring to form a sealing surface to prevent medium leakage.<br/>
3. Stationary seal ring
   O-ring, v-ring and other sealing rings made of synthetic rubber or polytetrafluoroethylene are used to prevent the leakage between the stationary ring and the gland (or between the stationary ring seat) and make the stationary ring float to a certain degree.
   <br />
4. Rotary seal ring
   Adopt the same sealing ring as the static sealing ring, to prevent the medium from leakage in the gap between the moving ring and the shaft, and make the moving ring have a certain floating, to ensure the good fit between the moving ring and the static ring, when the sealing surface is worn, the moving ring can produce axial movement.
   <br />
5. Elastic components
   Elastic elements mainly play the role of compensation and buffer.The elastic force makes the mechanical seal end face produce reasonable specific pressure, which is also the key factor affecting the service life and sealing performance of the mechanical seal.Elastic elements mainly include springs and bellows two kinds, usually using cylindrical spiral spring, but also using conical spring and waveform spring;The bellows type elastic elements include rubber bellows, ptfe bellows and metal bellows.
