1. Mechanism of shallow groove mechanical seals Dry gas seal (typical shallow groove
seal) is a kind of hydrodynamic and static seal, in the presence of medium pressure,
the force acting on the seal is hydrostatic, and exist in the sealing rotation or
static.
<br />
Under the traction of the rotary ring, due to the fluctuation of the flow boundary
on the sealing surface, the viscous flows along the circumferential direction alternately
experience convergence and divergence zones:

3. In the convergence zone, the fluid membrane generates a high fluid dynamic pressure, so that the circumferential wave degree formed by thermal deformation and force deformation can generate a static additional opening force;

4. In the divergence zone, negative pressure may be generated. Because the negative pressure that fluid can bear has certain limit, exceed this limit, the air that dissolves in liquid will be displaced, generation cavitation phenomenon. In addition, the radial taper formed by thermal deformation and force deformation makes use of hydrostatic effect to generate additional hydrostatic bearing capacity and increase the opening force.
