        "item3": "The surface roughness of the two sealing faces is treated with mist surface. On the premise of ensuring the flatness, the roughness is changed and the smoothness is not changed. At the same time, the current is reduced from the original 5A to the current 3.7a, which can well control the current loss of the motor and save the electric energy."
